    <p style="font-family: Arial Narrow">my passion for neuroscience first began in grade 10 while self-studying AP psychology! (got a 5 btw im the goat.) in particular, unit 2: biological bases and behaviour really piqued my interest-- learning the complexities of the brain showed me how much we currently know, and how much is still unknown to us.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: Arial Narrow">coincidentally, that was also the year i learned about the <a href="https://brainbee.ca/" target="_blank">brain bee</a> through ms. proctor! hosted in various cities in canada, the brain bee is a neuroscience competition designed for high school students,  pulling questions from free resources provided to you. that year, i barely studied because i thought my AP psychology knowledge would be enough. i was completely wrong and flopped, i think i got barely any questions right!</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: Arial Narrow">this year, i once again signed up for the brain bee!</p>
