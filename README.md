hey everyone! my name is vera and since brat summer is upon us, i decided to make a personal brat-themed website using html, css, and js as my first project! in this website, you can read more about my interests -- some cool things i've added consist of a navigation bar, 3d model, photo gallery, timeline, favicon, some songs here and there, and more! please feel free to connect with me on my socials if you'd like :D (also in the website!)

a quick preview:
